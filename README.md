# README.md

Welcome to the Tonies Presentations Repository!

In this repository, you will find all the presentations that have been shared and discussed within our organization. I apologize for not publishing them earlier, but all the content is now available for your reference and use.

## Contents

The repository includes a variety of presentation, that I should have uploaded earlier, sorry ;-)

## How to Use

Each folder within the repository is dedicated to a specific presentation. Inside each folder, you will find:

- The presentation slides in PDF format.
- Any supplementary materials or documentation referenced in the presentation.
- A README file providing an overview and key takeaways from the presentation.

## Getting Started

To view a presentation:

1. Navigate to the folder of the presentation you are interested in.
2. Open the PDF file to view the slides.
3. Refer to the README file in the folder for a summary and additional context.

## Feedback

Your feedback is valuable to me. If you have any suggestions for improving the presentations or this repository, please create an issue or contact me directly.
